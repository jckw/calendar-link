Any one of the fields `end`, `duration`, or `allDay` is required.

The allowed units in `duration` are listed here: https://day.js.org/docs/en/durations/creating#list-of-all-available-units.

The `url` field defaults to `document.URL` if a global `document` object exists. For server-side rendering, you should supply the `url` manually.

Not all calendars support the `guests` and `url` fields.
